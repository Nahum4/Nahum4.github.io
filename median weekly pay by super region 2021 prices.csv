Data Notes:,,
The weekly pay data is calculated as the average of the median weekly pays of each constituent region in each super-region.,,
The cost of living data is scraped from a MoneyNest table that shows the lowest average monthly spend in different cities. I then sorted these cities into their super-regions and took the average. I did not take the lowest one as my analysis is supposed to look at the super-regions in a more holistic way (not just saying which area is the cheapest to live in). ,,
