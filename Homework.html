    <h1>Nahum Locke</h1>
    <h1>Data Science 2021.</h1>

    <h2>This is my homework page. Some charts here may also appear in my project page.</h2>

</div>
    
<h3>Covid-19</h3>

<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by UK region. This chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick; click <a class="textLink" href="charlieMeyrick.html"> here</a> for his bio.</p> 

</div>

<!--Vaga embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

<script>
// Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
// One way to tell is to see how comments work...
// First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
// Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
// The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

<p>The second chart looks at productivity in the UK. As before, this chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
<script>
var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Inflation</h3>

<p>The third chart looks at inflation in the UK since 1800. I pulled the code for this chart from RapidCharts.io. As you can see, it's an interactive chart. </p>

<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
<script>
var myChart3 = "inflationInteractiveChartPremade.json";
vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
</script>

</div>


<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>My fourth chart looks at new COVID cases in three regions of the UK. I designed this chart by editing Charlie Meyrick's code.</p>
<p>This chart uses data from a government API.</p>

<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
<script>
var myChart4 = "week2CovidChartAPI.json";
vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
</script>

</div>
    
<p>My fifth chart looks at the number of new people who are fully vaccinated in the same three regions of the UK. As above, I used some of Charlie Meyrick's code for this one.</p>
<p>This chart uses data hosted on GitHub.</p>
<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">To see the data in this chart, click <a class="textLink" href="myCovidData.csv"> here</a>.</p> 
</div>


<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
<script>
var myChart5 = "week2NewVaccinationChartCSV.json";
vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
</script>

</div>

<!--Homework 4-->

</div>

<p>This is my sixth chart. It looks at... </p>
<p>I have added an observation to this chart... for homework 4.</p>


<div class="chart" id="sixthChart">
<script>
var myChart6 = "Inset chart URL here";
vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
</script>

</div>

  <p>For my seventh chart, I have created a bar chart showing the percentage of obese people in different regions of the UK (excluding the morbidly obese).</p>
<p>The data for this chart is "in-line" JSON that I wrote myself. The data is from NHS Digital.</p>


<div class="chart" id="seventhChart">
<script>
var myChart7 = "obesityRatesByRegionManualData.json";
vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
</script>
