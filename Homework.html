    <h1>Nahum Locke</h1>
    <h1>Data Science 2021.</h1>

    <p>This is my homework page. Some charts here may also appear in my <a class="textLink" href="Project.html">project page</a>.</p>
    <p>Click <a class="textLink" href="index.html">here</a> to return to the homepage.</p>

<h3>Covid-19</h3>

<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by UK region. This chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick; click <a class="textLink" href="charlieMeyrick.html"> here</a> for his bio.</p> 

</div>

<!--Vaga embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

<script>
// Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
// One way to tell is to see how comments work...
// First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
// Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
// The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

<p>The second chart looks at productivity in the UK. As before, this chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
<script>
var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Inflation</h3>

<p>The third chart looks at inflation in the UK since 1800. I pulled the code for this chart from RapidCharts.io. As you can see, it's an interactive chart. </p>

<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
<script>
var myChart3 = "inflationInteractiveChartPremade.json";
vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
</script>

</div>


<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>My fourth chart looks at new COVID cases in three regions of the UK. I designed this chart by editing Charlie Meyrick's code.</p>
<p>This chart uses data from a government API.</p>

<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
<script>
var myChart4 = "week2CovidChartAPI.json";
vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
</script>

</div>
    
<p>My fifth chart looks at the number of new people who are fully vaccinated in the same three regions of the UK. As above, I used some of Charlie Meyrick's code for this one.</p>
<p>This chart uses data hosted on GitHub.</p>
<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">To see the data in this chart, click <a class="textLink" href="myCovidData.csv"> here</a>.</p> 
</div>


<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
<script>
var myChart5 = "week2NewVaccinationChartCSV.json";
vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
</script>

</div>

<!--Homework 4-->

</div>
<h3>Editing Data</h3>
<p>I pulled this chart from Rapidcharts.io and edited the data for it to include a fake observation for my company, 'Nahum Co.'.</p>
<p> As you can see, we're very environmentally conscious.</p>



<div class="chart" id="sixthChart">
<script>
var myChart6 = "fakeLitterChart.json";
vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
</script>

</div>

  <p>For my seventh chart, I have created a bar chart showing the percentage of obese people in different regions of the UK (excluding the morbidly obese).</p>
<p>The data for this chart is "in-line" JSON that I wrote myself. The data is from NHS Digital.</p>


<div class="chart" id="seventhChart">
<script>
var myChart7 = "obesityRatesByRegionManualData.json";
vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
</script>

</div>

<h3>APIs</h3>
<p>These charts use APIs that I found, accessed and edited the URLs of as their data source. As such, they're always up to date.</p>

<p>The first looks at the number of registered suicides in the UK over time. If you, or anyone you know, is suffering with mental health, please call 116 123 for free.</p>


<div class="chart" id="eighthChart">
<script>
var myChart8 = "suicideChartAPI.json";
vegaEmbed('#eighthChart', myChart8);
</script>

  <p>Note - the colour schemes are inconsistent on this page at the minute as I'm still deciding on a scheme for my project.</p>
    
</div>


<p>I'm yet to upload the second chart</p>


<div class="chart" id="ninthChart">
<script>
var myChart9 = "Insert chart URL here";
vegaEmbed('#ninthChart', myChart9);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Loops</h3>
  <p>The following 4 charts show the average price of a draught pint of lager in different cities.</p>
<p>I downloaded the data for these charts by using fetch in Python, writing a loop to make 4 separate calls to the Numbeo cost of living API.</p>


<div class="chart" id="tenthChart">
<script>
var myChart10 = "leedsPintPrice";
vegaEmbed('#tenthChart', myChart10);
</script>

  <br>
   
</div>

<div class="chart" id="eleventhChart">
<script>
var myChart11 = "nottsPintPrice";
vegaEmbed('#eleventhChart', myChart11);
</script>

    <br>
    
</div>

<div class="chart" id="twelfthChart">
<script>
var myChart12 = "bristolPintPrice";
vegaEmbed('#twelfthChart', myChart12);
</script>

    <br>
    
</div>

<div class="chart" id="thirteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart13 = "cambridgePintPrice";
vegaEmbed('#thirteenthChart', myChart13);
</script>

    <br>
    
</div>

<h3>Data Stories</h3>

  <p>Chris Giles of the Financial Times claimed that the economy had adapted well to COVID and lockdowns such that the reduction in GDP following the second UK lockdown was far smaller. Using ONS GDP data, I calculated the percentage loss to GDP following each lockdown and charted my results. This chart supports Chris’ statement – the reduction in GDP following the second lockdown was roughly 16 percentage points lower.</p>


<div class="chart" id="fourteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart14 = "lockdownGDPLoss.json";
vegaEmbed('#fourteenthChart', myChart14);
</script>
