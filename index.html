    // One way to tell is to see how comments work...
    // First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:

  <h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

  <p>The second chart looks at productivity in the UK. As before, this chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">

    vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);

  <h3>Inflation</h3>

  <p>The third chart looks at inflation in the UK since 1800. I pulled the code for this chart from RapidCharts.io. As you can see, it's an interactive chart. </p>
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
  <script>
    var myChart3 = "inflationInteractiveChartPremade.json";

  <h3>COVID-19</h3>

  <p>My fourth chart looks at new COVID cases in three regions of the UK. I designed this chart by editing Charlie Meyrick's code.</p>
  <p>This chart uses data from a government API.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
  <script>
    var myChart4 = "week2CovidChartAPI.json";
    vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
  </script>
    
</div>
        
  <p>My fifth chart looks at the number of new people who are fully vaccinated in the same three regions of the UK. As above, I used some of Charlie Meyrick's code for this one.</p>
  <p>This chart uses data hosted on GitHub.</p>
  <div class="wrap">
