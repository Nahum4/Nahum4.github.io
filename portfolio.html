    <h1>Nahum Locke</h1>
    <h1>Data Science 2021.</h1>

    <p>This is my portfolio page. The charts on this page use a variety of data science techniques in their creation or the data they use. Some charts here may also appear in my <a class="textLink" href="Project.html">project page</a>.</p>
    <p>I have created these charts over the course of 6 weeks as I learnt the necessary skills, as such the colour schemes are quite inconsistent. See my project page for a more visually pleasing demonstration of my skills.</p>
    <p>Click <a class="textLink" href="index.html">here</a> to return to the homepage.</p>

<h3>Covid-19</h3>

<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by UK region. This chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick; click <a href="https://meyrickcharlieecon.github.io/">here</a> for his website.</p>
    
</div>

<!--Vaga embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

<script>
// Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
// One way to tell is to see how comments work...
// First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
// Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
// The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

<p>The second chart looks at productivity in the UK. As before, this chart was designed by Charlie Meyrick.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
<script>
var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
</script>

</div>

<h3>Inflation</h3>

<p>The third chart looks at inflation in the UK since 1800. I pulled the code for this chart from RapidCharts.io. As you can see, it's an interactive chart.</p>

<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
<script>
var myChart3 = "inflationInteractiveChartPremade.json";
vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
</script>

</div>

<!--Homework 3-->
    
<h3>COVID-19</h3>

<p>My fourth chart looks at new COVID cases in three regions of the UK. This chart uses the government API as it's data source, so should update automatically.</p>

<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
<script>
var myChart4 = "week2CovidChartAPI.json";
vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
</script>

</div>
    
<p>My fifth chart looks at the number of new people who are fully vaccinated in the same three regions of the UK. To get the data for this chart I edited the URL of the API used in my fourth chart. I downloaded the data, uploaded it to Github and used that as the chart's data source. Because of this, this chart will load faster than chart 4, but won't stay up to date.</p>

<div class="wrap">
<p class="rubric-launch">To see the data in this chart, click <a class="textLink" href="myCovidData.csv"> here</a>.</p> 
</div>


<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
<script>
var myChart5 = "week2NewVaccinationChartCSV.json";
vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
</script>

</div>

<!--Homework 4-->

</div>
<h3>Editing Data</h3>
<p>I pulled this chart from Rapidcharts.io and edited the data for it to include a fake observation for my company, 'Nahum Co.'.</p>
<p> As you can see, we're very environmentally conscious.</p>



<div class="chart" id="sixthChart">
<script>
var myChart6 = "fakeLitterChart.json";
vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
</script>

</div>

  <p>This bar chart shows the percentage of obese people in different regions of the UK (excluding the morbidly obese).</p>
<p>The data for this chart are "in-line" JSON, I wrote this myself. The data are from NHS Digital; I copied across the observations to the chart's JSON.</p>


<div class="chart" id="seventhChart">
<script>
var myChart7 = "obesityRatesByRegionManualData.json";
vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
</script>

    <!--Homework 5-->
    
</div>

<h3>APIs</h3>
<p>These charts use APIs that I signed up for, accessed and edited the URLs of as their data source. As such, they're always up to date.</p>

<p>The first looks at the number of registered suicides in the UK over time. If you, or anyone you know, is suffering with mental health, please call 116 123 for free.</p>


<div class="chart" id="eighthChart">
<script>
var myChart8 = "suicideChartAPI.json";
vegaEmbed('#eighthChart', myChart8);
</script>
    
</div>


<p>The second API driven chart in this section looks at the daily ozone concentration in two areas of the UK. The data for this chart are pulled from the Swagger emissions API.</p>


<div class="chart" id="ninthChart">
<script>
var myChart9 = "emissionsAPIChart.json";
vegaEmbed('#ninthChart', myChart9);
</script>

    <!--Homework 6-->
    
</div>

<h3>Python Fetch/Loops</h3>
  <p>The following 4 charts show the average price of a draught pint of lager in different cities.</p>
<p>I downloaded the data for these charts by using fetch in Python, writing a loop to make 4 separate calls to the Numbeo cost of living API.</p>


<div class="chart" id="tenthChart">
<script>
var myChart10 = "leedsPintPrice.json";
vegaEmbed('#tenthChart', myChart10);
</script>

  <br>
   
</div>

<div class="chart" id="eleventhChart">
<script>
var myChart11 = "nottsPintPrice.json";
vegaEmbed('#eleventhChart', myChart11);
</script>

    <br>
    
</div>

<div class="chart" id="twelfthChart">
<script>
var myChart12 = "bristolPintPrices.json";
vegaEmbed('#twelfthChart', myChart12);
</script>

    <br>
    
</div>

<div class="chart" id="thirteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart13 = "camPintPrices.json";
vegaEmbed('#thirteenthChart', myChart13);
</script>

    <br>

<h3>Data Scraping</h3>
<p>I built a scraper in Python to scrape house price data from GOV.UK. After formatting the data I scraped, I designed a bar chart to represent house prices in different regions of the UK. I also made this chart interactive - try hovering over the bars.</p>

<div class="chart" id="fourteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart14 = "scrapedHousePrices.json";
vegaEmbed('#fourteenthChart', myChart14);
</script>

</div>

    <!--Homework 8-->

<h3>Data Stories</h3>

  <p>Chris Giles of the Financial Times claimed that the economy had adapted well to COVID and lockdowns such that the reduction in GDP following the second UK lockdown was far smaller. Using ONS GDP data, I calculated the percentage loss to GDP following each lockdown and charted my results. This chart supports Chris’ statement – the reduction in GDP following the second lockdown was roughly 16 percentage points lower.</p>
<p>Note - at the minute I'm having trouble getting the data for this chart to show up.</p>

<div class="chart" id="fifthteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart15 = "lockdownGDPLoss.json";
vegaEmbed('#fifthteenthChart', myChart15);
</script>

</div>

<!--Homework 9-->

<div>
    
    <h3>Advanced Analytics</h3>
    <p>To come: build a chart using an advanced analytic technique from any data source.</p>
    
   <div class="chart" id="sixthteenthChart">
<script>
var myChart16 = "insert url here";
vegaEmbed('#sixthteenthChart', myChart16);
</script>

</div>
    
    <!--Homework 10-->

<div>
    
    <h3>Interactivity</h3>
    <p>This chart shows how median weekly incomes have changed in the East Midlands. It's an interactive chart - I incorporated a slider so you can choose the start year.</p>
    
   <div class="chart" id="seventeenthChart">
<script>
var myChart17 = "interactiveEMIncome.json";
vegaEmbed('#seventeenthChart', myChart17);
</script>
