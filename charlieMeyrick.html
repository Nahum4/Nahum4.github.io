    <h1>Charlie Meyrick: Data Visualisation Diary</h1>

    <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website. I currently run the Economics Observatory website and am manager of the Bristol hub. Having studied economics and mathematics at university, as well as completing a master's degree in international development, I am interested in improving the communication and accessibility of economic research. I have articles written for Bristol Festival of Economics and work as a copyeditor for the Centre for Economic Policy Research and VoxEU.</p>

    <p>The main purpose of this site is to document my Data Visualisation work – like a diary. This will be useful for me but may also help you – the user – learn how I work.</p>
    
    <p>Please feel free to use the dot icon in the top right corner of each chart to see the underlying code. This cutton will also allow you to download a png image of the chart. If you use my work, please credit me and/or my co-authors. Thank you. </p>
